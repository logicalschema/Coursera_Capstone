# The Battle of Neighborhoods

## Introduction/Business Problem

With NYC undergoing one of the worst economic crises in her lifetime with COVID and civil unrest, what would be the ideal restaurant to open in the Jackson Heights area of Queens, NY? Queens consists of invidividual villages such as Forest Hills (Spiderman's home) and Flushing (home of the Flushing Remonstrance and the U.S Open).


## Data to Solve the Problem

I will use the Foursquare data to look at the venues that are available in the area and analyze to find the trends to see if there is a type of cuisine that is popular and/or popular among the users who contribute to Foursquare.
